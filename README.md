First level

I designed the models using Eloquent ORM
Relations
    - one to many 
        - user has many tasks
        - project has many tasks

    - many to many
        - users and projects

Second level

used laravel built in validation for validating 
laravel returns 422 for validation error for other errors we can user middlewares
